                    This is a model of how culture emerges from people (agents)
                    sharing similar opinions, behaviours or fashions. Here the
                    people are represented by a square. The agents opinions,
                    behaviours and fashions are represented by features. The set
                    of features is represented by a color. The more similar the
                    color the more similar an agents culture is to another. Each
                    agent interacts with and influences the culture of the
                    agents in their immediate neighborhood.

                    Like Schelling (see Schelling segrataion model example),
                    Axelrod is a pioneer in the use of agent-based models (ABM)
                    in social sciences. The Axelrod model looks at the influence
                    of a person’s social network on the behaviour of an
                    individual agent(person).In this model each agent’s ideas or
                    culture can change depending on the influences from it’s
                    neighbours or “social networks”. Like the Shelling model,
                    the Axelrod model is a theoretical model that illuminates
                    the emergent complex behaviours of social networks.

                    This model does not directly address a non-communicable
                    disease (NCD) challenge, but provides a basis for
                    understanding more complex models of behaviour. As
                    illustrated in our other examples based on the Bhar model
                    (social influence on eating) and the Gorman model (social
                    influence on drinking) understanding how people’s behaviours
                    are influenced by their social networks is key to many NCDs.

                    What sets ABMs apart from other modelling methods is global
                    behaviour emerging from rules that apply across the whole
                    model but are enacted by individuals based on who they are
                    linked to, their social network. Influence flows across the
                    network altering each agent's culture in an iterative manner
                    to produce both local and global consensus. This dynamic
                    spatially heterogeneous behaviour of the global culture
                    would be very hard to model with other methodologies.

                    The Axelrod model is a model of social influence where a
                    person becomes more like a person they are linked to. It
                    models the social convergence of culture.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each agent, or person, is static in its own cell within a
                    two dimensional matrix. Each agent has four
                    neighbours/contacts within their social network: those
                    directly above, below, to the left and right of the agent
                    within the grid matrix. Note that an agent does not share
                    any other contacts with each of its four contacts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each agent's culture is represented as a set of 5 features.
                    Each feature is described by a trait, that is a single value
                    between XX and XX.. An agent's similarity to any of its
                    contacts is measured by how many features that each has that
                    have the same trait. For example if agent A has a feature
                    set [5,2,7,4,6] and the agent it contacts above it has the
                    feature set [2,8,7,7,3] then the two agents share the same
                    trait at feature 3 (both are trait 7) so have a similarity
                    of 1⁄5 or 20%.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An agent will influence another agent in direct proportion
                    to their similarity. When one agent does influence the other
                    a random feature is chosen and the traits of both the agents
                    for that feature are made equal. So for agent A and agent B
                    above there is a 20% chance they will interact. A's feature
                    set will change from [5,2,7,4,6] to [5,2,7,7,6], a change in
                    feature 2 to match the trait of its neighbour (both now
                    trait 7). Note that there is now a 40% similarity.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In this simulation the different sets of features are
                    represented by a single colour. Similar feature sets have
                    similar colours. Over a number of iterations the random
                    patchwork of colours converges on blocks of similar colours
                    as groups of agents converge on similar cultures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What is interesting is to see what effect changing the
                    population size the number of iterations and the number of
                    features has on the spatial heterogeneity. This can be done
                    by moving the sliders on the right of the model and
                    re-running the model with the "Reset" button. The patterns
                    formed by the model can be quite mesmeric.

                    Two interesting outcomes from the model are: the move to a
                    common culture in smaller populations and the occurrence of
                    lockout groups when the number of features that constitute a
                    culture are small. While this is only a simple theoretical
                    model it does highlight some possible obstacles that may
                    occur in both addressing diversity and in changing mindsets.
