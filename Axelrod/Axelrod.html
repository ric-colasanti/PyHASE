    <h2>Why is this a good example?</h2>
    Like Schelling, Axelrod is a pioneer in the use of agent based models in social science. Like the Schelling
    segregation model the Axelrod model looks at the influence on the behaviour of an individual agent ( person ) by a
    social network of it’s immediate neighbours. In the Axelrod model it is not its geographic position that changes but
    that agent ideas or culture. Like the Shelling model the Axelrod model is a theoretical model but one that is equal
    powerful as the Shelling model in ilumiation the emergent complex behaviours of social networks.
    <p>
    </p>

    <h2>What is the NCD prevention challenge being addressed?</h2>
    There is no direct non communicable disease (NCD) that is being addressed her but as is illustrated in the Bhar mode
    ( social influence on eating ) and the Gorman model ( social influence on drinking ) understanding the how agents
    are influenced by their social networks is key to many NCDs
    <p>
    </p>

    <h2>How is ABM suited to address this challenge?</h2>
    <p>
      As with the Shelling model, what sets Agent Based Models (ABM) apart from other modelling methods is global
      behaviour emerging from rules that apply across the whole model but are enacted by individuals based on who they
      are linked to, their social network. Influence flows across the network altering each agent's culture but all
      iterating to produce both local and global consensus. This dynamic spatially heterogeneous behaviour of the global
      culture would be very hard to model with other methodologies.
    </p>

    <h2>How does the model work?</h2>
    <p>
      The Axelrod model is a model of Social influence where a person becomes more like a person they are linked to. It
      models the social convergence of culture. Unlike the Shelling mode each agent is static in its own cell of a two
      dimensional matrix. Each agent can see four neighbours/contacts. North East South and West of the cell that it
      occupies. Note that an agent does not share any contacts with any of its contacts. Each agent's culture is
      represented as a set of 5 features. Each feature is described by a single trait. An agent's similarity to any of
      its contacts is measured by how many features that each has that have the same trait. For example if agent A has a
      feature set [5,2,7,4,6] and its contact to the North has the feature set [2,8,7,7,3] then the two agents share the
      same trait at feature 3 ( both are trait 7) so have a similarity of ⅕ or 20%.</p>
    <p>
      An agent will influence another agent in direct proportion to their similarity. When one agent does influence the
      other a random feature is chosen and the traits of both the agents for that feature are made equal. So for agent A
      and agent B above there is a 20% chance they will interact. A's feature set will change from [5,2,7,4,6] to
      [5,2,7,7,6]. Note that there is now a 40% similarity.</p>

    <p>In this simulation the different sets of features are represented by a single colour. Similar feature sets
      have similar colours. Over a number of iterations the random patchwork of colours converges on blocks of similar
      colours as groups of agents converge on similar cultures.</p>
    <p>What is interesting is to see what effect changing the population size the number of iterations and the number of
      features has on the spatial heterogeneity. This can be done with sliders on the right and re-running the model
      with the "Reset" button. The patterns formed by the model can be quite mesmeric</p>
    <h2>
      What are the implications of these findings for policy or practice?
    </h2>
    <p>Two interesting outcomes from the model are: The move to a common culture in smaller populations and the
      occurrence of lockout groups when the number of features that constitute a culture are small. While this is only a
      simple theoretical model it does highlight some possible obstacles that may occur in both mating diversity and in
      changing mindsets.
