                    This is a model of how culture emerges from people (agents) sharing similar opinions, behaviours or fashions. Here the people are represented by a square. The agents opinions, behaviours and fashions are represented by features. The set of features is represented by a color. The more similar the color the more similar an agents culture is to another. Each agent interacts with and influences the culture of the agents in their immediate neighborhood.

                    Like Schelling, Axelrod is a pioneer in the use of agent based
                    models in social science. Like the Schelling segregation model
                    the Axelrod model looks at the influence on the behaviour of an
                    individual agent ( person ) by a social network of itâ€™s
                    immediate neighbours. In the Axelrod model it is not its
                    geographic position that changes but that agent ideas or
                    culture. Like the Shelling model the Axelrod model is a
                    theoretical model but one that is equal powerful as the Shelling
                    model in ilumiation the emergent complex behaviours of social
                    networks.

                    As with the Shelling model, what sets Agent Based Models (ABM)
                    apart from other modelling methods is global behaviour emerging
                    from rules that apply across the whole model but are enacted by
                    individuals based on who they are linked to, their social
                    network. Influence flows across the network altering each
                    agent's culture but all iterating to produce both local and
                    global consensus. This dynamic spatially heterogeneous behaviour
                    of the global culture would be very hard to model with other
                    methodologies.

                    The Axelrod model is a model of Social influence where a person
                    becomes more like a person they are linked to. It models the
                    social convergence of culture. Unlike the Shelling mode each
                    agent is static in its own cell of a two dimensional matrix.
                    Each agent can see four neighbours/contacts. North East South
                    and West of the cell that it occupies. Note that an agent does
                    not share any contacts with any of its contacts. Each agent's
                    culture is represented as a set of 5 features. Each feature is
                    described by a single trait. An agent's similarity to any of its
                    contacts is measured by how many features that each has that
                    have the same trait. For example if agent A has a feature set
                    [5,2,7,4,6] and its contact to the North has the feature set
                    [2,8,7,7,3] then the two agents share the same trait at feature
                    3 ( both are trait 7) so have a similarity of â…• or 20%.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An agent will influence another agent in direct proportion to
                    their similarity. When one agent does influence the other a
                    random feature is chosen and the traits of both the agents for
                    that feature are made equal. So for agent A and agent B above
                    there is a 20% chance they will interact. A's feature set will
                    change from [5,2,7,4,6] to [5,2,7,7,6]. Note that there is now a
                    40% similarity.
                  </p>
    
                  <p>
                    In this simulation the different sets of features are
                    represented by a single colour. Similar feature sets have
                    similar colours. Over a number of iterations the random
                    patchwork of colours converges on blocks of similar colours as
                    groups of agents converge on similar cultures.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What is interesting is to see what effect changing the
                    population size the number of iterations and the number of
                    features has on the spatial heterogeneity. This can be done with
                    sliders on the right and re-running the model with the "Reset"
                    button. The patterns formed by the model can be quite mesmeric

                    Two interesting outcomes from the model are: The move to a
                    common culture in smaller populations and the occurrence of
                    lockout groups when the number of features that constitute a
                    culture are small. While this is only a simple theoretical model
                    it does highlight some possible obstacles that may occur in both
                    mating diversity and in changing mindsets.
