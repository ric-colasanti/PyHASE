    "## Agent based model (ABM)\n",
    "ABM are where persons (or agents) in a society are modeled as individuals within a computer program. The behaviour of the complete system emerges from the interaction of the agents with their environment and with each other. One of the earliest sociology ABMs is that deals with inter agent influence is Axerod's model of the dissemination of Culture\n",

    "\n",
    "The Axelrod model is a model of Social influence is where a person becomes more like a person they are linked to. It models the social convergence of culture. Unlike the Shelling mode each agent is static in its own cell of a two dimensional matrix. Each agent can see four neighbours/contacts. North East South and West of the cell that it occupies. Note that an agent does not share any contacts with any of its contacts,contacts. Each agents culture is represented as a set of  5 features. Each feature is described by a single trait. An agents similarity to any of its contacts is measured by how many  features that each has that have the same trait. For example if agent A has a feature set [5,2,7,4,6] and its contact to the North has the feature set [2,8,7,7,3] then the two agents share the same trait at feature 3 ( both are trait 7) so have a similarity of ⅕ or 20%.\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent will influence another agent in direct proportion to their similarity. When one agent does influence the other a random feature is chosen and the traits of both the agents for that feature are made equal. So for agent A and agent B above there is a 20% chance they will interact. A's feature set will change from [5,2,7,4,6] to [5,2,7,7,6]. Note that there is now a 40% similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simulation below the different sets of features are represented by a single color. Similar feature sets have similar colors. Over a number of iterations the random patchwork of colors converges on blocks of similar colors as groups of agents converge on similar a culture.\n",

    "1.   As a function of the two agent’s similarity determine if the two agents will interact.\n",
    "2.   If the agents do interact randomly pick a feature and for the randomly chosen agent set the trait of that feature to the same value as that of its selected neighbour\n",
