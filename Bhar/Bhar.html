                      This is a good model to explore and understand network
                      theory[ see referance 2 in links]. One of the most
                      important features of an ABM is the way in which the
                      agents interact with each other. In this model social
                      networks within a population are created by forming links
                      between agents. The agent-to-agent links represent
                      connections between a person and their friends. In this
                      model this friendship network is used to simulate the
                      effect that a person's friends have on their body weight.
                      This abstract model shows that the structure of this
                      friendship network is very important in determining
                      population level patterns of behaviour.

                    <p>This model is concerned with obesity.</p>
                    <p>
                      Between 1971 and 2003, the population of the city of
                      Framingham was part of a cardiac health study where 12,067
                      people's health data were repeatedly collected. A
                      long-term analysis of weight data and the social network
                      the population by Christakis and Fowler [1] showed that a
                      person’s chances of becoming obese increased by almost 70%
                      if they had a friend who became obese. In this study by
                      Christakis and Fowler, the social network describes the
                      relationships between peopleincluding friends, family and
                      co-workers. Each person can be thought of as node within
                      the network and the relationships as links between the
                      nodes. Networks of nodes and links are found throughout
                      nature and society. A branch of mathematics called network
                      theory[2] can be applied to these networks to identify
                      common patterns and behaviours. Using network theory,
                      artificial networks of social interactions can be
                      constructed that have the same important characteristics
                      of real social networks. These artificial networks can
                      then be used to simulate how obesity spreads among social
                      networks and to test the effectiveness of different weight
                      management interventions on reducing obesity at the
                      population level.

                      The Bhar paper shows that the behaviour presented at the
                      population level is dependent on the nature of the
                      interactions at the individual level. An agent-based model
                      allows you to model a range of personal interactions and
                      observe how these affect the behaviour of the population
                      as a whole. A small change in individual behaviour can
                      result in a totally different outcome at the population
                      level. This type of behaviour is known as a “phase
                      change”. Mathematical or statistical models of whole
                      populations are less good at capturing this type of
                      behaviour. In the context of the management of obesity
                      this means we can test different individual-level
                      interventions and see how the effects propagate across the
                      population.

                      The simulation recreated here models a population of
                      individual agents (people) that are represented as
                      different coloured dots on the grid. Each agent can be in
                      one of three weight states: healthy weight (<span
                        style="color: green"
                        >green</span
                      >)over weight (<span style="color: blue">blue</span>) and
                      obese (<span style="color: red">red</span>). In this
                      version of the Bhar model each agent occupies an
                      individual space on a 40 by 40 grid. Each agent has a
                      social network consisting of the agent’s eight immediate
                      neighbours on the grid. As the model runs, at each
                      iteration step an agent will change its weight state to
                      match that of the majority of its social network
                      neighbours (i.e. the surrounding agents on the grid).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Because the agents are linked together in a grid-like
                      network, it means that each agent has two friends in
                      common with every other agent in their social network,
                      although note that these will be two different friends for
                      each agent within the social network. This results in a
                      network that has a high clustering coefficient with agents
                      likely to take on the weight-state of their neighbours .
                      The effect of this can be seen in the relatively stable
                      clustering of weight type when the simulation is run. The
                      number of common friends, and thus the clustering
                      coefficient can be reduced by adding random links within
                      the model so that each agent is also connected to other
                      agents who are not next to them in the grid.

                      Click the Setup button, which will assign each agent to an
                      individual space on the 40 by 40 grid. Each agent then
                      makes a friendship link with its eight closest neighbours.
                      Additional friendship links can be made to random members
                      of the population. The number of such links is controlled
                      by the random links slider. The top three sliders in the
                      model (Healthy, Over, and Obese) determine the proportion
                      of the population assigned to one of the three weight
                      states at the model setup: healthy weight(<span

                      obese (<span style="color: red">red</span>).

                    <p>
                      To run the model, click on the Run button. The model will
                      run until there is no change in the population or until
                      you click the stop button. The speed the simulation runs
                      at can be altered with the Speed slider. You can change
                      the initial conditions by changing the values of the
                      sliders and then clicking the Setup followed by the Run
                      button
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If you run the model a few times you will note that the
                      outcomes will not always be the same. This is because the
                      initial distribution of agents and types has a random
                      element in it.

                    <p>
                      The aim of the model is to demonstrate the effect that
                      social network structure has on population behaviour. Try
                      running the model a few times after making each of the
                      following adjustments:
                    </p>

                    <h6>&#9679; No random links between agents</h6>
                    <p>
                      With no random links, there are many common friends and
                      you can see strong clustering in weight behaviours.
                      Friends influence friends and where there are common
                      friends, a group behaviour is reinforced.
                    </p>

                    <h6>&#9679; Select Lock 50 healthy</h6>
                    <p>
                      When you choose 50 healthy people and lock their weight
                      type to being constant for all of the simulation the group
                      reinforcement can be seen more clearly. These healthy
                      individuals act as group centres and help maintain healthy
                      group behaviour.
                    </p>

                    <h6>
                      &#9679; Increase the number of random links between agents
                    </h6>
                    <p>
                      You see that group cohesion and clustering coefficient is
                      reduced by adding random links and the effect of locking
                      in 50 individuals is greatly reduced.

                      This is an abstract model: people don't vote with their
                      friends as to what weight they should be, and social
                      networks are not as uniform in real life as they are in
                      this version of the Bhar model. Also, fixing a set number
                      of people at a healthy weight will not solve the obesity
                      epidemic. What this model does show is the qualitative
                      effect that social networks have on group behaviour and
                      this is just the type of behaviour documented by
                      Christakis and Fowler. The model presented here is just
                      one version of the models outlined in the full Bhar et al
                      paper where the authors explore a wider range of social
                      network structures and differing methods that influence
                      the majority state of each agent’s social network
                      neighbours.

                    <p>
                      What this model and the Bhar et al paper show is that
                      weight regulation is not solely an individual act and that
                      any intervention to help people regulate their weight
                      needs to take social connections into account. One of the
                      interventions looked at in the Bhar et al paper is dieting
                      with friends. More realistic models have been created from
                      both the Bhar et al and the Christakis and Fowler papers.,
                      For example Giabbanelli et al. applied network theory to
                      generate artificial social networks. They include a simple
                      model of human metabolism and simulated how individuals
                      influence each other with respect to food consumption and
                      physical activity. They applied their model to both
                      synthetic and real-world populations and demonstrated the
                      importance of the structural properties of each
                      individual’s social network on the distribution of body
                      mass and obesity at the population level. In another
                      example by Shi et al a networked ABM was created with an
                      age and height structured metabolic model to investigate
                      weight loss interventions in a real Chinese population.
