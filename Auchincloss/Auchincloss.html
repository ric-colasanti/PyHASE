                    This is an excellent example of using an agent-based model
                    (ABM) to ask “what if” questions about aspects of individual
                    behaviour that would be very difficult to replicate within a
                    real population. In this case the positioning of different
                    types of food outlets within neighborhoods.

                    This is a model of the inequalities in diet in the context
                    of urban residential segregation. Auchincloss and Garcia use
                    this model as an example of how to create an ABM to address
                    complex non-communicable disease(NCD) problems. The model is
                    used as an introductory guide to the philosophy and
                    practices of ABMs and is used to illustrate why ABMs are a
                    good fit for investigating NCD prevention. The paper
                    describes very clearly how to take descriptions of
                    individual behaviour and incorporate them into an ABM
                    framework and run “what if “ experiments with the model.

                    This model investigates the inequalities in diet in the

                    One of the contributory factors to obesity and
                    obesity-related health conditions and illness is the high
                    consumption of nutrient-poor energy-dense foods. Numerous
                    population studies have shown that there is a higher
                    prevalence of nutrient-poor energy-dense foods in the diets
                    of lower income families compared with higher income
                    families. One of the contributing factors to this difference
                    in diet quality is access to healthy food outlets. It has
                    long been recognised that urban landscapes are influenced by
                    residential segregation based on both economic and ethnic
                    factors and that there is a marked difference in resources
                    and services between these areas. (See the model by Thomas
                    Schelling included in this series for an ABM of
                    segregation). Lower income neighbourhoods usually have far
                    fewer outlets that provide healthy foods compared to higher
                    income neighbourhoods. Auchincloss and Garcia’s model looks
                    at the role of economic segregation on food outlet
                    distribution and looks at possible “policy levers” that may
                    be used to counteract this.

                    As is demonstrated by the Schelling model segregation and an
                    individual's response to it is a function of the spatial
                    location of populations. The nature of the spatial location
                    of the individuals is governed by local factors and tends to
                    be heterogeneous. By that we mean that the spatial pattern
                    of the population tends not to a smooth gradation but tends
                    to be a more patchy pattern. This type of spatial
                    distribution is very hard to be incorporated in traditional
                    mathematical or statistical models but is very easy to
                    implement with an Agent Based Model (ABM). In this model we
                    are mainly looking at the decisions that outlets make on
                    their location, and food and price. The rule based nature of
                    ABMs makes construction of a shop based model both simpler
                    and transparent.

                    Here we present a simplified version of Auchinclosss model
                    that concentrates on just the effect that segregation has on
                    the success and type of food outlets within a neighbourhood.

                  <p>
                    The model has two entities, people and shops. Each person is
                    represented by a small dot. Each shop is represented by a larger circle. The color of the center of the shop circle identifies the shop. This color is mirrored in the person dot color and indicate if that person is a customer of that shop. The outer Outer color of the shop circle indicates the type of shop: <span style="color: darkblue">High end </span>shop, <span style="color: darkred">Convenience </span> shop.
                  </p>
                  <p> At the start of the simulation each person is allocated a square ( a home ) on the grid. A class is of neighborhood is assigned to each home : affluent ( indicated by a dark background ) , non-affluent ( light background ). If the simulation is non-segregated then the neighborhood class is assigned randomly. If it is a segregated simulation the affluent neighborhood is assigned the top have of the grid.</p>
                  <p>
                    At each iteration each person chooses the nearest shop. The shop they choose is indicated by the color of the dot of the person. Each person spends a set amount at the shop. A person from an affluent neighborhood will spend more at a high-end shop than a person from a non-affluent neighborhood. They both spend the same amount at the convenience store.

                    In a follow-up paper in which Auchincloss's uses this model of residential segregation to look at the impact of income inequalities on diet in more detail, [2] the author concludes:
                    "<i>The model underscores the challenges of fostering favorable
                      behavior change when people and resources are residentially segregated and behaviors are motivated or constrained by multiple factors. Simulation modeling can be a useful
                      tool for proposing and testing policies or interventions that will ultimately be implemented in a complex system where the consequences of multidimensional
                      interactions are diffıcult to predict.</i>"
