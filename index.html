        <p> This is an excellent example of using modelling to ask “what if” question of aspects of individual behaviour
          that would be very difficult to replicate with a real population. In this case the positioning of food
          outlets.

          This is a model of the inequalities in diet in the context of urban residential segregation. It has been used
          by Auchincloss and Garcia as an example of how to create an Agent Based Model (ABM) to address complex Non
          Communicable Disease(NDC) problems. The model is used as an introductory guide to the philosophy and practices
          of ABMs and is used to illustrate why ABMs are a good fit for NDC investigation. The paper describes very
          clearly how to take descriptions of individual behaviour and incorporate them into an ABM framework and run
          “what if “ experiments with it. </p>

        <p> Like Schelling, Axelrod is a pioneer in the use of agent based models in social science. Like the Schelling
          segregation model the Axelrod model looks at the influence on the behaviour of an individual agent ( person )
          by a social network of it’s immediate neighbours. In the Axelrod model it is not its geographic position that
          changes but that agent ideas or culture. Like the Shelling model the Axelrod model is a theoretical model but
          one that is equal powerful as the Shelling model in ilumiation the emergent complex behaviours of social
          networks.</p>

        <p> This is a good model to explore and understand network theory[ see referance 2 in links]. One of the most
          important features of an ABM is the way in which the agents interact with each other. In this model social
          networks within a population are created by forming links between agents. The agent-to-agent links represent
          connections between a person and their friends. In this model this friendship network is used to simulate the
          effect that a person's friends have on their body weight. This abstract model shows that the structure of this
          friendship network is very important in determining population level patterns of behaviour. </p>

      <div class="col-sm-8 bgTextBox">
        <p> This is a particularly good example of using an abstract, spatially discrete ABM (Agent Based Model) to investigate the fundamental drivers of behavior. The model looks at the effect that other people’s drinking behavior has on an individual's drinking behavior and places this in a quite simple spatial context. It finds that the spatial aspects of social interactions are an important driver in determining population level drinking behavior. This model is also a much-cited precursor to more applied ABMs used for investigating drinking behavior such as SimDrink</p>

        <p> Schelling's segregation model can be said to be the first sociology Agent Based Model (ABM). It took a
          complex social behaviour of racial segregation and asked if it could be captured by some simple rules. What
          makes the model exceptional are the range and types of behaviours that this simple model exhibits. These types
          of behaviours are known as emergent and this is one of the first models of its type to exhibit this. Many
          sociological ABMs can trace their lineage back to this model. If you are interested in ABMs for simulating
          non-communicable disease (NCD) is well worth your while getting to know Schelling's segregation model.

        <p> One of the other modelling methods in complex systems science is network models. Two of the pioneers of
          modern network modelling were Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz. Among their contributions to modelling was the
          small world network. This model gives one possible explanation for the famous six degrees of separation. In
          the 1960’ the social psychologist Stanley Milgram tried to get letters sent to random people in the USA by
          people passing on the letter to people they personally knew who may be closer to the target then they were.
          The results showed that on average it took just six intermediate people to pass on the letter. If our
          connections to other people were just random then the number of intermediates required for people to pass on
          the letter would be much higher. Watts and Strogatz small world model posited that connections are locally
          made but with the occasional link to someone more distant would account for the behaviour seen by Milgram.The
          connections between agents (people ) are important to understanding emergent social behaviour. We have all
          recently experienced this with the spread of COVID19. In this demonstration we use a simple agent based model
          (AMB) combined with the small world model to show the effect of long distance links to the spread of a
          disease. </p>
