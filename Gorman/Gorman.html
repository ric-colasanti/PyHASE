                    This is a particularly good example of using an abstract,
                    spatially discrete ABM (Agent Based Model) to investigate
                    the fundamental drivers of behavior. The model looks at the
                    effect that other people’s drinking behavior has on an
                    individual's drinking behavior and places this in a quite
                    simple spatial context. It finds that the spatial aspects of
                    social interactions are an important driver in determining
                    population level drinking behavior. This model is also a
                    much-cited precursor to more applied ABMs used for
                    investigating drinking behavior such as SimDrink

                    This model asks: How can drinking behavior at the population
                    level be influenced by environmental and social
                    interactions? A key factor, in answering this question is
                    that people’s drinking behavior is very dynamic. For
                    example, it has been observed that over a year 75% of people
                    classified as alcohol dependent will no longer be classified
                    as such. Researchers into alcohol consumption have noted
                    that social and environment interactions are key factors in
                    determining drinking behavior.

                    This study uses an ABM to ask what effect the spatial
                    environment has on an individual's social interactions and
                    how these interactions affect the drinking behavior of an
                    individual and thus influence the overall drinking behavior
                    of the population.

                    Drinking behavior is both socially and spatially complex. It
                    involves interactions between the micro-level of individual
                    decisions and the macro-level of social interactions. The
                    social level interaction will in turn depend on the spatial
                    structure of the environment and on the movement of
                    individuals within that environment. All these factors are
                    difficult to study both ethnographically and experimentally.
                    This ABM facilitates asking what the role of environment
                    connectivity on drinking behavior is and what happens if
                    specific drinking spaces, such as pubs, are added to the
                    environment. Both these questions would be extremely
                    difficult to answer with real world experiments

                    The ABM is an abstract spatially discrete model. The model
                    does not attempt to capture all the factors that influence
                    drinking behaviors. It looks at just direct peer effect and
                    environment space. It does so in a very abstract and
                    theoretical way. The environment is represented as a simple
                    one-dimensional grid of spaces. People are represented as
                    simple agents that can be in one of three drinking states:
                    never-drank, current-drinker, and former-drinker. (The model
                    does not include lifelong teetotalers). Each agent occupies
                    an individual grid space and can move between adjacent
                    spaces. Each space can contain any number of agents. An
                    agent’s state is influenced by its current state and the
                    states of the other agents that occupy the same space.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There are two versions of the model. In one, the agents move
                    randomly between adjacent spaces. In the other, the agents
                    also move randomly, but the agents who are current drinkers
                    move preferentially towards a “pub” placed within the
                    environment.

                    The key components of the model are the rules that govern an
                    agent’s change in drinking state. The never-drank state is
                    described in the paper as susceptible and given the symbol
                    S. The current-drinker state is described as a drinker and
                    given the symbol D. The former-drinker state is described as
                    recovered and given the symbol R.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The transition rules are: The S state can change to a D
                    state. A D state can change to an R state and a R state can
                    change to a D state.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This means that a person who has never drunk (S) can become
                    a drinker (D), but a drinker can never become a person who
                    has never drunk. A drinker (D) can stop drinking and become
                    a former drinker (R), but that person can start drinking
                    again to become a drinker (D).
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The actual transition from one state to another is dependent
                    on the state of the other agents in the same grid space and
                    an intrinsic transition rate. For each space in the grid
                    (the index i is used to identify the space) the total number
                    of agents for each state is calculated (S(i), D(i), R(i))
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The probability of transitioning from never drinking (S) to
                    drinking (D) is proportional to the fraction of drinkers
                    among the other agents in the same grid space. The
                    probability of transitioning from drinking (D) to being a

                    The experimenter can change the rate at which the agents
                    move between grid spaces and the intrinsic rates of stopping
                    drinking and resuming drinking. The experimenter can also
                    introduce a space that preferentially attracts drinkers, a
                    “pub”.

                    The results from this model highlight the role that the
                    environment has on alcohol use especially the roles that
                    alcohol outlets play in shaping social interactions.
                    Including a pub in the model limited the movement of current
                    drinkers and locally spread drinking behavior. Those agents
                    who stayed away from the pub space were less exposed to
                    direct social influences to drink. The other side of this
                    could be that the pub space segregates and concentrates
                    current drinkers into more insular subgroups with possible
                    knock-on behavior of normalizing drinking behavior.
