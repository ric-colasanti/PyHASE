      <h2>Why is this a good example?</h2>
      <p>
        Schelling's segregation model can be said to be the first sociology
        Agent Based Model (ABM). It took a complex social behaviour of racial
        segregation and asked if it could be captured by some simple rules. What
        makes the model exceptional are the range and types of behaviours that
        this simple model exhibits. These types of behaviours are known as
        emergent and this is one of the first models of its type to exhibit
        this. Many sociological ABMs can trace their lineage back to this model.
        If you are interested in ABMs for simulating non-communicable disease
        (NCD) is well worth your while getting to know Schelling's segregation
        model.
      </p>

      <h2>What is the NCD prevention challenge being addressed?</h2>
      <p>
        Schelling's segregation model does not directly address a
        non-communicable disease (NCD) but social segregation does play a part
        in a number of NCD issues. See our other modelling example the urban
        health model of Auchincloss that investigates the inequalities in diet
        in the context of urban residential segregation.
      </p>

      <h2>How is ABM suited to address this challenge?</h2>
      <p>
        What sets Agent Based Models (ABM) apart from other modelling methods is
        global behaviour emerging from rules that apply across the whole model
        but are enacted by individuals based on local information. In this case
        we are looking at individuals' choice of home based on just the racial
        makeup of their very local neighbourhood. The model asks the simple
        question of what happens to the global level of segregation if
        individuals make their housing choice based on how many people are like
        them in the local neighbourhood. ABMs can model systems and ask
        questions of systems like these because ABMs model each of the different
        individuals that make up the population.
      </p>

      <h2>How does the model work?</h2>
      <p>
        The model is amazingly simple. In this version of the model the world is
        divided into a 40 by 40 grid. Each cell of the grid can either be empty
        or have a blue agent (a person) or a red agent. Each agent has a
        neighbourhood of the closest 8 other cells on the grid. At each
        iteration every agent counts the number of agents in the closet 8 other
        cells on the grid and notes the percentage that are the same colour as
        themselves. If that percentage is less than globally set level then the
        agent randomly picks an empty cell and moves there. That is all the
        rules are. They are so simple that Schelling originally did the first
        models by hand using a paper grid. In this version of the model the
        total number of agents in the model is set with the population density
        slider. The global acceptance value is set with the alike slider. Re-run
        the model with the reset button. Run the model with differing levels of
        global acceptance. Not how the behaviour changes around 30%.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is such an important model that along with this webbased javascript
        version we have added links to a NetLogo and a Python version.
      </p>
      <h2>
        What are the implications of these findings for policy or practice?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The main implication for policy that this model demonstrates is that the
        effect of local individual decisions on global measurable attributes
        like the segregation of a community are not immediately obvious from
        just analysing an individual's behaviour in isolation.
