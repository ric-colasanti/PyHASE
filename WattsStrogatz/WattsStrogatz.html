                    One of the other modelling methods in complex systems
                    science is network models. Two of the pioneers of modern
                    network modelling were Duncan Watts and Steven Strogatz.
                    Among their contributions to modelling was the small world
                    network. This model gives one possible explanation for the
                    famous six degrees of separation. In the 1960’s the social
                    psychologist Stanley Milgram tried to get letters sent to
                    random people in the USA by people passing on the letter to
                    people they personally knew who may be closer to the target
                    then they were. The results showed that on average it took
                    just six intermediate people to pass on the letter. If our
                    connections to other people were just random then the number
                    of intermediates required for people to pass on the letter
                    would be much higher. Watts and Strogatz small world model
                    posited that connections are locally made but with the
                    occasional link to someone more distant would account for
                    the behaviour seen by Milgram. The connections between
                    agents (people) are important to understanding emergent
                    social behaviour. We have all recently experienced this with
                    the spread of COVID19. In this demonstration we use a simple
                    agent-based model (ABM) combined with the small world model
                    to show the effect of long distance links to the spread of
                    an infectious disease.

                    The same model that can be used to model disease spread can
                    be applied to the spread of influence. This is seen in our
                    example of the Bhar model of the social influence on diet:
                    the behaviour presented at the population level is dependent
                    on the nature of the interactions at the individual level.
                    Networks are found throughout nature and society. Despite
                    their apparent random appearance network theory can be
                    applied to these networks to identify common patterns and
                    behaviours. Using network theory, artificial networks of
                    social interactions can be constructed that have the same
                    important characteristics of real social networks. These
                    artificial networks can then be used in models with the
                    assurance that they will behave in the same way as real
                    social networks found in society

                    As previously stated network models are another modelling
                    type used in complex systems science. Adding an ABM to a
                    network model makes it easier to incorporate geographical
                    position and allows individual agent’s (people’s) behaviour
                    rules to be included in the model. This is particularly
                    important when modelling emergent social behaviour.

                    Each agent can be in one of three states: susceptible to
                    disease (green
                    <span style="color: rgba(0, 255, 0)">&#9679;</span>),
                    Infectious( ill, red
                    <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0)">&#9679;</span>)
                    ,Recovered ( but not susceptible,orange
                    <span style="color: rgba(255, 227, 177)">&#9679;</span>)
                    Each agent is connected to eight other agents, the members
                    of its social network. Initially each agent is linked to its
                    eight immediate neighbours on the grid. A random agent is
                    chosen to develop the disease and it then potentially
                    infects the other agents it is linked to with a given
                    probability. This is the now famous “R” number. The agent
                    remains ill and infectious for a set number of days at which
                    point it recovers. In this state the agent will not catch
                    the disease again. This recovered state lasts for a set
                    time. At the end of that time the agent is then susceptible
                    again.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    When the model has only local links the disease spreads as a
                    single wave across the population. Most of the time there is
                    only a single wave. You can alter this behaviour by creating
                    a “small world”. Here you add links between random agents
                    with the links slider. The number on the links slider
                    represents the probability that a single local link will be
                    replaced by a random link to another part of the grid. These
                    links are shown as a blue line. When the model is reset
                    using the reset button you will see that the disease now has
                    multiple spatial and temporal waves.

                    The influence of social networks has been seen in a number
                    of models focussed on NCD prevention, For example, in the
                    Framingham heart study the relationships described by
                    Christakis and Fowler are friends, family and coworkers and
                    an individual propensity to obesity is seen to be influenced
                    by the nature of these connections. This is also seen in our
                    Bhar diet model example. Investigators such as Giabbanelli
                    and Shi have also used this knowledge of networks to test
                    out different intervention strategies targeting the most
                    connected individuals.
